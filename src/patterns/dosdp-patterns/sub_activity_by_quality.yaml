pattern_name: sub_activity_by_quality

pattern_iri: https://github.com/Active-Animals/Ontology/patterns/sub_activity_by_quality

description: >-
  This generic pattern captures lower level (usually terminal), quality-type, subdivisions of activities. Unless this is simply a subdivided subdivision, the parent activity should have a specific pattern (neither lower nor upper level generic pattern).

  Examples:
  - fast-turn: turn that has an 'increased' velocity
  - S-turn: fast-turn that has a sigmoid quality
  - contrast: tint that has a luminance quality
