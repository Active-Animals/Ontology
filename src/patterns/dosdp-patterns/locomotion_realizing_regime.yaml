description: >-
  This pattern captures locomotion activities, defined by the regime and form of behaviour switching that they realize, along with the particular kinetic activities that are involved.

  Examples:
  - burst-coast-regime: swimming that realizes an 'intermittent' locomotion regime and 'phased' switching, by using sprinting and coasting
  - take-off-regime: transitioning that realizes a 'transitional' regime and 'transition' switching, by using launch-thrust
