pattern_iri: https://github.com/Active-Animals/Ontology/patterns/kinetic_activity_with_quality

description: >-
  A kinetic activity (motion-based behaviour) characterized by a specific
  quality. This pattern captures kinetic activities that are distinguished
  by qualitative properties such as speed, repetition, symmetry, etc.

  Examples:
  - coasting: kinetic activity that has quality 'inactive'
  - biting: mouth-opening that has quality 'closed'
  - chewing: mouth-opening that has quality 'repetitive'
  - stabilising: kinetic action that has quality 'stable'
  - sprinting: kinetic activity that has quality 'high-speed'
