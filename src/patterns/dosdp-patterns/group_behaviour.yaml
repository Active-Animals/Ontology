description: >-
  This pattern captures the emergent behaviour of an aggregation of animals, defined by the collective configuration that it realizes.

  Examples:
  - toroid: '3-dimensional' aggregation that realizes the 'milling' type of collective configuration
  - pair-bonding: 'paired' aggregation that realizes the 'dyadic' type of collective configuration
