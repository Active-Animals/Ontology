pattern_iri: https://github.com/Active-Animals/Ontology/patterns/chain_by_flexibility

description: >-
  A behavioural chain (sequence of behavioural elements) characterized by
  a specific flexibility quality. This pattern distinguishes chains that
  are stereotyped/inflexible versus flexible/variable in their execution.

  Examples:
  - inflexible (stereotyped): chain that has quality 'rigid'
  - fixed action pattern: chain with highly predictable rigid pattern
  - flexible chain: chain with variable execution
