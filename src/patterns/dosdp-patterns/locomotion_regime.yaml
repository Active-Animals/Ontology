description: >-
  This pattern captures locomotion activities, defined by the pedestrian modes and gait patterns that they realize, supplemented by the particular kinematic and kinetic activities that are involved.

  Examples:
  - anguilliform-gait: BCF swimming that realizes a limbless, aquatic lateral undulating gait pattern, by using a bending movement with added-mass push
