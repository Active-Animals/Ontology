description: >-
  This pattern captures locomotion activities, defined by the regime that they realize, along with the particular kinetic activities that are involved, and the form of switching behaviour used.

  Examples:
  - burst-coast-regime: swimming that realizes an 'intermittent' locomotion regime, by using sprinting and coasting with 'phased' switching
  - take-off-regime: transitioning that realizes a 'transitional' regime, by using launch-thrust with 'transition' switching
