description: >-
  A specific type of locomotion that is characterized by a particular
  locomotor mode (the environmental medium or substrate used for travel).
  This pattern captures locomotion types like flying (aerial), swimming
  (aquatic), walking (substratal), or burrowing (fossorial).

  Examples:
  - flying: locomotion that has part 'aerial' locomotor mode
  - swimming: locomotion that has part 'aquatic' locomotor mode
  - walking: locomotion that has part 'substratal' locomotor mode
  - climbing: locomotion that realizes 'suspended' mode
