description: >-
  A movement kinematic that involves a specific anatomical structure as
  participant. This pattern is used for movements characterized by the
  body part that performs or is involved in the movement.

  Examples:

  - stepping: traversing that has participant 'appendage'

  - tongue movement: movement that has participant 'tongue'
