description: >-
  This pattern captures locomotion activities, defined by the gait pattern and (predominant) pedestrian disposition that they realize, supplemented by the particular kinematic and kinetic activities that are involved.

  Examples:
  - anguilliform-gait: BCF swimming that realizes the aquatic lateral undulating gait pattern and limbless pedestrian disposition, and uses a bending movement with added-mass push
