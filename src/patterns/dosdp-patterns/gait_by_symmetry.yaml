description: >-
  A gait (locomotor chain) characterized by a specific symmetry pattern.
  The gait realizes a particular symmetry quality, such as symmetric or
  asymmetric limb coordination.

  Examples:
  - single-footed gait: gait that realizes 'symmetric' coordination
  - alternating-tetrapodal gait: gait that realizes 'symmetric' coordination
  - hopping: gait that realizes 'asymmetric' coordination
  - contralateral-bipodal: gait that realizes 'symmetric' with contralateral pattern
