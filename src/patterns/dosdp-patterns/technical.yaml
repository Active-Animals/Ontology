description: >-
 This pattern captures technical activities (including tool use), defined by the kinetic activities that operate along with the material entities involved.

  Examples:
  - attaching: constructing that uses adherence and involves an environmental material
  - decorating: object-placing that uses lifting and involves an environmental material
  - wiping-with-object: tooling that uses wiping and involves an environmental material
