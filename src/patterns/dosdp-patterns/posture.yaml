description: >-
  This pattern captures posture activities, defined by the positional modes and regimes that they realize, supplemented by the particular placement activities that are involved.

  Examples:
  - hanging posture: posture positioning that realizes the 'suspensory' type of positional mode, and uses 'gripping' kinetics
