description: >-
  A behaviour that realizes a specific disposition, state, or function.
  This pattern captures behaviours defined by what they realize, such as
  defensive behaviours realizing defense, locomotor behaviours realizing
  locomotion states, or activities realizing specific functions.

  Examples:
  - swarming: aggregating that realizes 'emergent' and 'disordered'
  - postural: positional that realizes 'stationary'
  - locomotor: positional that realizes 'state'
  - envenoming: secreting that realizes 'inflexible' (fixed action pattern)
  - balling: lying that realizes 'defense'
