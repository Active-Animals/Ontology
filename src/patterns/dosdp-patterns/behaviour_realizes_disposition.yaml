description: >-
  A behaviour that realizes specific dispositions.
  This pattern captures behaviours defined only by what they realize, such as   aggregating realizing a collective form of motion, activity realizing a repertoire, or locomotion realizing a specific environment-related mode.

  Examples:
  - aerial-planktonic kinetics: activity that realizes the 'aerial' mode
  - swarming: aggregating that realizes an 'emergent' repertoire and a 'disordered' form of collective-motion
  - posture: positioning that realizes a 'reduced-activity' repertoire
