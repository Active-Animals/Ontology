pattern_iri: https://github.com/Active-Animals/Ontology/patterns/kinematic_activity_with_participant

description: >-
  A kinematic activity that involves a specific anatomical entity as
  participant. This is the general pattern for kinematic activities
  (placements, movements, manoeuvres) that are characterized by the
  anatomical structure involved.

  Examples:
  - kinematic activity: has participant 'anatomical entity' (general)
  - kinetic activity: has participant 'anatomical entity'
  - stepping: traversing that has participant 'appendage'
